I am a senior network engineer with over 8 years of experience in large enterprise-level and ISP networks. I have extensive experience working with the Cisco Nexus series (5k, 7k, and 9k) and troubleshooting major circuit connectivity with carriers. I am also well-versed in load balancing (F5 or Citrix Netscaler, etc) and NAC (Cisco ISE).
I am also highly skilled in automation and scripting, cloud experience (including IaC) and observability, logs and tools. My deep service/systems engineering knowledge, customer-focused attitude, and insatiable curiosity make me the perfect candidate for this role.
In addition, I have ServiceNOW experience, Cisco certifications, Cisco 9300 Access Switch experience, Cisco WAP experience, and Citrix Netscaler experience (Load Balancing/VIPs).
I am confident that my expertise in these areas, combined with my experience in large-scale networks, makes me the ideal candidate for this role. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in greater detail.
